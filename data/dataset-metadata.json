Espero que ela volte online o quanto antes para que o script possa atualizar automaticamente este conjunto de dados.

I hope that it came back online to script can update the dataset.\n\nNote: Before 03/18/2020, the IVIS platform started maintenance to update. In order to keep the dataset up to date, I am collecting the cases from the news.\n\n---\n\n\n[![forthebadge made-with-python](http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/) [![ForTheBadge built-with-love](http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/built-with-love.svg)](https://GitHub.com/unanimad/)\n\n---\n\nPlease, If you enjoyed this dataset, don't forget to upvote it.\n\n---\n\n### Content\n\nFrom [Novel Corona Virus 2019 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset):\n&gt; 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus (more specifically, a coronavirus) identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China. Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring. At this time, it’s unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people - [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/index.html)\n\nThis dataset has information on the number of cases in Brazil. Please note that this is a time series data and so the number of cases on any given day is a cumulative number.\n\nThe data is available from Jan/30/2020, when the first suspect case appeared in Brazil.\n\n&gt; Note: There's a missing data at Mar/09/2020, I tried to find it on my old backups and on the Public Platform but also the data is missing.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n1.
