Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring. At this time, it’s unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people - [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/index.html)\n\nThis dataset has information on the number of cases in Brazil. Please note that this is a time series data and so the number of cases on any given day is a cumulative number.\n\nThe data is available from Jan/30/2020, when the first suspect case appeared in Brazil.\n\n---\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n1.
